It loads a pre-installed operating system—a tangled inheritance of biological impulses, tribal social scripts, and centuries-old cultural memes. This is your **factory settings**.

                        <p>With root access established and the terrain mapped, the system is no longer running on blind, inherited defaults. It is in an **aware, diagnostic state**.</p>
                        <p>The next step is defense. You cannot rewrite the world's buggy code, but you can build a secure interface with it. Part 2: **<a href="autonomous-system-2.html">The Firewall</a>** provides the architecture for this—the protocols for "Interfacing with the Incomprehensible" without internal compromise.</p>
