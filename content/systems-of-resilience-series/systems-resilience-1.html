                    <p>The will to stupidity was about deliberate limitation. <em>Amor Fati</em> (love of fate) is about deliberate embrace - not just acceptance, but <strong>active celebration</strong> of everything that happens, especially the painful parts.</p>

                            <p><strong>Removing harmful elements</strong> is more effective than adding beneficial ones. Health comes from removing toxins, not just adding supplements.</p>
                            <p><em>Ask: "What can I remove that's making me fragile?"</em></p>

                            <p><strong>Small, frequent exposures</strong> to manageable stress build immunity to larger stressors. Like vaccines for chaos.</p>
                            <p><em>Ask: "What controlled stress can I seek today?"</em></p>

                            Let me carry burdens that become strengths.<br>
                            Let chaos find me — and make me better.<br>
                            Not despite the breaking,<br>
                            but because of it.<br>
                            Not to survive the fire,<br>
                            but to be forged by it.
