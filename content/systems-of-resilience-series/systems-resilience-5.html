                            I am breakable <em>and</em> rebuildable.<br>
                            I am not immune to chaos.<br>
                            I am nourished by chaos.<br>
                            I do not avoid being unmade.<br>
                            I embrace being remade.<br>
                            My fractures are where the light enters.<br>
                            My scars are where wisdom lives.<br>
                            I am becoming who the challenges require me to become.<br>
                            And I will integrate that person into who I am.<br>
                            I am resilient not despite being broken,<br>
                            but because I have learned to break<br>
                            and reform<br>
                            <strong>stronger each time.</strong>
