                    <h3>The Two Faces of Regret</h3>
                    <p>In the Introduction, we established that hesitation is surrender. Now we explore why: because the regret born from inaction hurts far more - and lasts far longer - than the regret born from action.</p>
                    
                    <div class="card" style="text-align:center; margin:2rem auto;">
                        <p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.1rem; font-style:italic;"><br>
                            "In the end, we only regret the chances we didn't take,<br>
                            the relationships we were afraid to have,<br>
                            and the decisions we waited too long to make."
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>While we fear the immediate sting of action-based regret, we systematically underestimate the chronic, soul-eroding pain of regret born from inaction. This miscalculation is at the heart of why we hesitate.</p>
