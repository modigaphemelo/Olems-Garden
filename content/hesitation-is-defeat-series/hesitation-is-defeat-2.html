                    <p>We spend our lives trying to avoid failure, yet every significant achievement in human history required countless failures along the way. The people we admire most are not those who never failed, but those who failed courageously and learned brilliantly.</p>

                    <p>Developing courage is essential, but we also need practical systems to translate that courage into consistent action. Courage provides the spark, but frameworks provide the fuel.</p>
