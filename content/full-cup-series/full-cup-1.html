                    <p>Before you can fill your cup, you must understand why it's empty. The modern condition of depletion is not an accident of personality or circumstance. It is the <strong>designed output of a moral system</strong> that has weaponized self-sacrifice, turning what appears as virtue into a mechanism of control.</p>

                    <p>This part excavates the foundational lie that shapes our relationships to ourselves and others: the belief that putting others first is inherently moral, and that prioritizing oneself is inherently selfish. We will trace how this morality of sacrifice functions as <strong>social architecture</strong>—redistributing energy from the capable to the dependent, and binding the strong to service of the herd.</p>
