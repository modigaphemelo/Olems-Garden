                    <p>Everything you create—whether art, business, writing, or relationships—bears the imprint of your internal state. Your work is not just what you do; it's <strong>who you are made visible</strong>. This part explores how the quality of your contribution reflects the quality of your cup.</p>

                    <p>When you create from depletion, your work carries the marks of struggle, desperation, and compromise. When you create from overflow, your work carries the marks of mastery, generosity, and integrity. The difference is palpable to those who know how to look.</p>
                    <p>Contribution as artifact means treating everything you put into the world as <strong>evidence of your internal condition</strong>. Your creations become diagnostics of your wholeness.</p>

                            <li><strong>Process Quality:</strong> Was the creation process renewing or draining?</li>
                            <li><strong>Signature Strength:</strong> Does this bear my unmistakable mark, or could anyone have made it?</li>
                            <li><strong>Timelessness Potential:</strong> Will this still have value in five years? Fifty?</li>

                        <p>The pattern will reveal your dominant creation mode. Extractive creation leaves you tired and the work forgettable. Generative creation leaves you energized and the work memorable.</p>

                    <p>Moving from extractive to generative creation requires systematic change.</p>

                            <h4>Phase 1: Energy Management</h4>
                            <p>Stop creating when depleted. This seems obvious but is rarely practiced. Establish minimum energy thresholds for creative work. If you're below the line, replenish first, create second.</p>

                            <p>Separate creation from validation. Create something with no intention of sharing it. Write for the drawer. Paint for the basement. Remove the audience from the equation until the work stands on its own.</p>

                            <p>Identify what only you can create. What unique combination of experiences, skills, and perspectives do you bring? Lean into that uniqueness rather than smoothing it out to fit expectations.</p>

                        <p>The hardest shift is psychological: from "Will they like it?" to "Is it true to what wants to be born?" This requires developing what artists call "a strong inner critic"—not the voice that says "this is terrible" but the voice that says "this isn't yet what it could be."</p>

                            <p>The work explores fundamental human experiences rather than chasing trends. It feels familiar even when new because it touches something perennial.</p>

                        <p>The most important artifact you'll ever create is <strong>yourself</strong>. Your character, your mind, your way of being. Everything else you make flows from this primary creation.</p>
                        <p>When you create from a self built on the Full Cup Principle, your external creations naturally carry its marks: wholeness, generosity, integrity, timelessness. They become artifacts not just of your skill, but of your state.</p>
                        <p>This is contribution as artifact: you put into the world not just what you can do, but <strong>who you have become</strong>. The work becomes evidence of the journey.</p>
