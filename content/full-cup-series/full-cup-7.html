                    <p>Having built internal wholeness and mastered contribution, we arrive at the practical system: <strong>managing your personal economy</strong>. Not money—though that's part of it—but the deeper currencies: attention, time, focus, and creative energy. This is fiscal policy for the sovereign individual.</p>

                    <p>The modern world is an extraction economy designed to harvest your attention, fragment your focus, and commodify your time. Operating within it while maintaining sovereignty requires <strong>deliberate economic design</strong>. You must become both central bank and chief economist of your personal economy.</p>
                    <p>This part provides the framework for treating your energy as capital, your attention as currency, and your time as the most valuable asset you'll ever manage.</p>

                            <p>Defend your attention. Implement digital minimalism. Create focus blocks. Say no to non-essential commitments. Build the fortress before accumulating wealth inside it.</p>

                            <p>Develop compound skills. Learn things that make other things easier. Build relationship equity with key amplifiers. Create assets that work while you sleep.</p>

                            <p>Systematize what works. Delegate or automate low-value tasks. Create platforms that multiply your impact. Shift from trading time to creating systems.</p>

                            <p>Design your ideal economic life. Work only on what matters. Have multiple income streams. Maintain high freedom quotient. The economy serves you, not vice versa.</p>

                        <p>The transition requires temporary discomfort. Saying no feels risky. Investing in skills feels slow. Building systems feels abstract. But like compound interest, the returns accelerate. Year one: modest gains. Year three: noticeable difference. Year five: fundamentally different economic reality.</p>

                        <p>The sovereign economy isn't about getting rich—it's about getting <strong>free</strong>. Free from the anxiety of scarcity. Free from the tyranny of the urgent. Free from trading your life for things that don't matter.</p>
                        <p>It's about designing an economic life where your values determine your allocations, where your attention goes to what nourishes rather than what drains, where your energy compounds into something meaningful.</p>
                        <p>This is the practical implementation of everything that came before in this series. Without economic sovereignty, the other forms of sovereignty are fragile. With it, they become unshakable.</p>
