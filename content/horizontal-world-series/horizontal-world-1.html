                    <h3>The Western Binary</h3>
                    <p>The Western imagination is vertical. It reaches upward. For millennia, meaning came from above: God, the Forms, the Ideal, the Transcendent. When Nietzsche declared "God is dead," he wasn't celebrating—he was diagnosing a structural collapse. The vertical axis had broken.</p>

                    </div><br>

                    <p>Left with a broken vertical axis, Western thought sees only two options: desperately reconstruct the vertical (fundamentalism, ideology, "higher purpose") or collapse into the abyss (nihilism, absurdism, existential dread). This is the vertical crisis.</p>
