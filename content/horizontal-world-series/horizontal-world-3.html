                    <p>If Confucianism gives us the social operating system, Taoism gives us the physics of the horizontal world. The Dao (道) isn't a thing or a god—it's the fundamental pattern that organizes reality.</p>

                    <p>This isn't mysticism. It's practical observation: reality has a grain, like wood. Cut against the grain, and you struggle. Cut with the grain, and the wood splits easily. The Dao is that grain.</p>

                        <h4>2. Frugality (Jian)</h4>
                        <p>Not miserliness, but efficiency. Using exactly what's needed, no more. Waste creates friction. Frugality is energy conservation for what matters.</p>
                        
                        <h4>3. Not Presuming to Lead (Bugan wei tianxia xian)</h4>
                        <p>Not avoiding responsibility, but leading from behind. The best leader is the one people barely notice. When the work is done, they say: "We did it ourselves."</p>

                        <p><strong>Throughout day:</strong> When you meet resistance, pause. Ask: "Is there another angle? A softer approach? An empty space I'm not seeing?"</p>
                        <p><strong>Evening:</strong> Review: Where did you flow easily? Where did you struggle? What pattern was at work?</p>
