                        <p>"Before I studied Zen, mountains were mountains, and waters were waters.<br>
                        After I studied Zen for some time, mountains were no longer mountains, and waters were no longer waters.<br>
                        But now, after understanding Zen, mountains are again mountains, and waters are again waters."</p>
                    </div><br>

                    <p>This isn't mystical obfuscation. It's a precise map of the mind's journey from ordinary consciousness, through philosophical confusion, back to ordinary consciousness—but transformed.</p>

                            <p>The physical posture creates the mental state. Straight spine, relaxed shoulders, hands in cosmic mudra. You don't achieve enlightenment—you sit in the posture of enlightenment.</p>

                        <p><strong>2. Simplicity as Power:</strong> Complexity is distraction. Simplicity is clarity. Doing less, but completely.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Acceptance as Freedom:</strong> Not passive resignation, but clear seeing of what is. Fighting reality is exhausting; seeing it clearly is liberating.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Impermanence as Ground:</strong> Everything changes. Trying to hold on creates suffering. Flowing with change creates freedom.</p>

                            <p>Not preparation for something else. Sitting zazen is itself enlightenment. Washing dishes is itself enlightenment.</p>

                        <p><strong>1. Sit daily:</strong> 5 minutes. Just sit. Straight spine, natural breath. When mind wanders, return to breath.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Choose one activity:</strong> Make it "just this" practice. Washing dishes, walking, drinking tea. Do it with full attention.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Notice the mountain:</strong> Throughout day, check: Am I the mountain (awareness) or the weather (thoughts)?</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Embrace boredom:</strong> When bored, don't reach for distraction. Sit with it. Boredom is the mind craving stimulation. Let it be.</p>
