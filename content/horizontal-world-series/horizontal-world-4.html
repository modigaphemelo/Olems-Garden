                    <p>Mono no Aware (物の哀れ) is untranslatable, but we can approximate: "the pathos of things," "the ah-ness of things," or "the bittersweet poignancy of impermanence." It's the emotional capacity to be simultaneously saddened and appreciative of transience.</p>

                        <p><strong>4. Tranquility (Jaku):</strong> The result of the first three. A moment of perfect, transient peace.</p>

                        <p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Each day, notice one thing that's imperfect or temporary. Instead of judging it, find what's beautiful about its imperfection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Choose one activity to do with full awareness of its transience. A meal, a conversation, a walk.</p>
                        <p><strong>Week 3:</strong> Find something aging or weathered. Appreciate its patina. What stories does it tell?</p>
                        <p><strong>Week 4:</strong> Let something end well. A project, a phase, a habit. Mark its ending consciously.</p>
