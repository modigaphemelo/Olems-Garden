                    <h3>Beyond Empty Ceremony</h3>
                    <p>To the Western eye, Confucian ritual (礼, Li) looks like empty formalism—rote behavior, social theater, meaningless tradition. This misunderstanding reveals the depth of the vertical/horizontal divide.</p>
                    
                    <div class="simple-box">
                        <p>"Li is not about what you do. It's about what doing it does to you."</p>
                    </div><br>

                    <p>Li isn't ceremony for ceremony's sake. It's <strong>reality-generation software</strong>. Every bow, every greeting, every prescribed interaction isn't just maintaining social order—it's constructing the psychological reality in which meaning exists.</p>
